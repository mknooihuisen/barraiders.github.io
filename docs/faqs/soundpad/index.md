# SoundPad - Troubleshooting

## "Soundpad Not Running" error
Make sure you're running the [PAID version](https://leppsoft.com/soundpad/en/buy/). The plugin is not supported in the trail version of Soundpad (because the API doesnâ€™t exist in this version).
If you recently installed the paid version of Soundpad, you may need to restart your computer.
