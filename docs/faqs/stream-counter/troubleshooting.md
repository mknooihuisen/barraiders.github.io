# Stream Counter - Troubleshooting

## Access Denied in FileName after pressing Save
You're trying to save to a location where the plugin doesn't have permission to write too. Instead try `c:\temp\myfile.txt` or your *My Documents* folder.

## Pressing `...` doesn't open file explorer
If clicking the `...` doesnâ€™t open file explorer the plugin has lost connection and the Stream Deck software needs restarting.

!!! note

    File explorer might also be opening up behind your other open windows. Make sure to check your taskbar to see if File Explorer is there.
